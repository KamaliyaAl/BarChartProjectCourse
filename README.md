# Data Visualization Course with JetBrains Plugin

This project provides a course focused on mastering **data visualization** techniques using the **JetBrains plugin**. Throughout this course, you will explore fundamental data visualization skills with **Matplotlib** and **Pandas**, two powerful Python libraries widely used for data analysis and visualization.

## Project Goals
The primary goal of this course is to introduce you to:
- Using **Matplotlib** for creating detailed, informative visualizations.
- Manipulating and preparing data with **Pandas** for analysis and visualization.
- Developing practical skills to represent data through various chart types, including bar charts.

## Final Project
At the end of the course, you will have built a **bar chart** using Matplotlib and Pandas, representing a practical application of the skills youâ€™ve acquired. This project will serve as a foundation for more complex visualizations and data-driven projects in the future.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.11+**
- **JetBrains IDE** with the relevant course plugin.
- **Libraries:** Matplotlib, Pandas

## Installation
Clone this repository and install the required libraries:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KamaliyaAl/BarChartProjectCourse.git
pip install matplotlib pandas
```

## Getting Started
Open the project in your JetBrains IDE and follow the course steps. Each lesson includes hands-on exercises designed to guide you through creating and customizing data visualizations with Matplotlib and Pandas.



Happy coding and enjoy your journey in data visualization!
