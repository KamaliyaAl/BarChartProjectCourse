*Tasks to Practice Data Manipulations*

**Handling Missing Data and Renaming Columns**
   - **Create a function `rename_columns`** which takes a DataFrame as an argument. Rename the 'Name' column to 'Employee Name' and the 'Salary' column to 'Annual Salary'. Return the updated DataFrame.

   - **Create a function `drop_missing_salary`** which takes a DataFrame as an argument. Remove any rows where 'Annual Salary' is missing (NaN) and return the cleaned DataFrame.

   - **Create a function `group_by_age_group`** which takes a DataFrame as an argument. Group the DataFrame by 'Age' and calculate the mean 'Annual Salary' for each age group. Return a new DataFrame with 'Age' and the mean 'Annual Salary'.
