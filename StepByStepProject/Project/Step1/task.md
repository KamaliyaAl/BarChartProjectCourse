## Data Loading
*Task: Load Data Using Pandas*

In this task, you will perform the following steps:

## Steps:

1. **Load the Data**:
- Implement a function called `load_the_data(filename)` that takes a file path (CSV format) as input and loads the data using the `pandas` library.
- Use the `pd.read_csv()` function to read the CSV file and return the result as a `DataFrame`.

2. **Use the Data**:
- Specify the whole path to the filename (dataset.csv):
  ```
  filename = ''
  ```
  Ensure that the file path exists and the file is a valid CSV with data.

3. **Run the Code**:
- Use the function to load the data from the specified file.

4. **Optional Steps**:
- Explore the loaded data: use the method `df.head()` to view the first few rows and verify that the data has been loaded correctly.
