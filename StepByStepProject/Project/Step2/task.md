## Steps:

1. **Filter Required Columns**:
- Implement a function `required_columns(df)` that selects and returns only the following columns from the dataset: `name`, `platform`, and `genre`.

2. **Run the Code**:
- Apply the filtering function.

3. **Optional Steps**:
- Make sure you filtered correctly: use the methods `df.head()` and `df.info()` to view the first few rows and verify that the data has been filtered correctly.
