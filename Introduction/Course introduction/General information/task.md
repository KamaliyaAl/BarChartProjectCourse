# Data Visualization in Python: Creating Bar Charts

## Course Overview

In this course, we will explore the art of data visualization using Python, with a specific focus on creating bar charts. Bar charts are an essential tool for representing categorical data, allowing us to visually compare different groups and understand trends effectively. By the end of the course, you will have the skills to create, customize, and interpret bar charts using Python libraries.

## Tools and Libraries

Throughout the course, we will utilize the following tools and libraries:

- **Python 3.9+**: The programming language we will use for all our coding exercises.
- **Pandas**: A data manipulation library that allows us to load, clean, and prepare datasets for visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: A powerful plotting library that provides the ability to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

We will use these libraries because they are widely adopted in the industry and provide the necessary functionalities to create high-quality visualizations.

## Course Format

The course is structured into several sections, including:

1. **Introduction to Course**: This section if for you to know what is this course about and what will you learn.
2. **Preparation to the project**: We'll cover all basic knowledge required to construct first bar chart and to be ready for the project.
5. **Final Project**: Applying your skills in a comprehensive project.

Preparation section will include lessons with theory and practical assignments that reinforce the concepts learned. These hands-on tasks will help you solidify your understanding and gain confidence in your data visualization skills.

## Final Project: Creating a Bar Chart

In the final part of the course, you will undertake a project focused on creating a bar chart that visualizes the number of games across four specific gaming platforms (PS4, XOne, PC, and WiiU) by game genre. 

### Project Steps:
- **Data Loading**: You will load a dataset containing information about various games, including their genres and platforms.
- **Data Preparation**: You'll clean and prepare the data using Pandas to focus specifically on the platforms and genres required for the bar chart.
- **Chart Creation**: You will create a bar chart using Matplotlib that accurately represents the number of games for each genre on the specified platforms.
- **Customization**: Finally, you'll enhance your chart by customizing its appearance, adding labels, legends, and ensuring it conveys the data effectively.

By the end of this project, you will not only have a visually appealing bar chart but also a deeper understanding of how to manipulate data and create insightful visualizations.
